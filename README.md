# Communication-System-Experiments
The lab assignments and project in Communication System Experiments by Prof. Chia-Yi Yeh, Fall 2024

## Lab 01
Generate three BER-SNR figures assuming an AWGN channel:
- comparing natural code vs Gray code using 16-QAM modulation.
- comparing BPSK, QPSK, and 8-PSK using gray code.
- comparing 16-PSK and 16-QAM using gray code

## Lab 02
- Perform upsampling and downsampling
- Apply the Square Root Raised Cosine (SRRC) filter.

## Lab 03
- Implement OFDM transmission
- Implement Wi-Fi Short Training Sequence (STS) and Long Training Sequence (LTS) for frame synchronization

## Lab 04
- Implementation of Wi-Fi-based OFDM transmission on USRP
- CFO estimation and correction

## Lab 05
- Simulate cross-USRP transmission and reception, with demonstration in class.
